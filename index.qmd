Hey there, I'm Vish! :grinning:     
I am a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute (LTI) specializing in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I'm currently interested in exploring the **reasoning** abilities of language models, from commonsense/mathematical reasoning :brain: , programming :computer: , or decison-making/agentic behaviour :robot:, and improving the same with *interaction* and verifiable *feedback* :repeat:.     
I'm also interested in making ML more **efficient** through interventions on architectures and data!

During my undergrad years at PES University, Indian Institute of Science and Intel, I worked on projects in various domains of ML from Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Graph ML, Continual Learning and Computer Vision.

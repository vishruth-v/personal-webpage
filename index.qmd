Hey there, I'm Vish! :grinning:     
I am a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute (LTI) specializing in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I'm broadly interested in exploring the abilities that emerge out of language-grounded exploration in interactive settings. This could either be commonsense reasoning :brain: , programming :computer: , or decison-making/agentic behaviour :robot:

I'm currently working on Code Generation :computer:, and improving efficiency of generated code in an interactive setting, advised by [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io). 

During my undergrad years at PES University, Indian Institute of Science and Intel, I worked on projects in various domains of ML from Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Graph ML, Continual Learning and Computer Vision.

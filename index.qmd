:::{#vishruth}

Hey there, I'm Vish! :grinning:     
I am a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute (LTI) specializing in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I'm currently working on :computer: **Code Generation** and improving efficiency of generated code, advised by [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io). I'm also interested in :robot: Autonomous Digital Agents and Language Grounding.

During my time at PES University (and internships at the Indian Institute of Science and Intel), I worked on projects in various domains of ML from Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Graph ML, Continual Learning and Computer Vision.

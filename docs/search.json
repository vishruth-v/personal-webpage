This could either be commonsense reasoning üß† , programming üíª , or decison-making/agentic behaviour ü§ñ\nI‚Äôm currently working on Code Generation üíª, and improving efficiency of generated code in an interactive setting, advised by Daniel Fried.\nDuring my undergrad years at PES University, Indian Institute of Science and Intel, I worked on projects in various domains of ML from Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Graph ML, Continual Learning and Computer Vision.\nCheckout my üìÉ Publications here!"
